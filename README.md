#Briefly describe your project in a paragraph or two.

Our product is a website that displays information on the team and its events. The site will include an informational portion, an email sign-up for the team’s newsletter, and a discussion/message board for the team. The informational portion will either be updated by the school’s IT team or as a project to learn HTML for the team. The newsletter will be either an email or a form that sends its contents to the emails in our database. The discussion/message board will be accessible by the team and allow the team-based discussion to be consolidated and recorded in one place.

Additionally, our site includes other features for visitors to participate in practice quizzes, display upcoming events, and participate in entertainment features that include a page for generating encouraging messages. The practice quizzes cover many different subjects that are covered by the team. The upcoming events display basic information on travel and the location of upcoming events that the team is participating in. We also have a login feature built into our site that we did not get to fully utilize, but future features will require it and future versions of our discussion boards will utilize it.
